TEXT_98=References
TEXT_33=Symptoms usually occur about 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus. There have been some cases where the illness started sooner or later after first contact. People with active symptoms of illness are contagious, but it is not known for how long a person may be contagious before or after symptoms appear.
TEXT_97=SARS
TEXT_32=With other coronaviruses, becoming infected and then getting sick again (re-infection) is common. This may also be the case with SARS.
TEXT_96=Alternative Names
TEXT_31=While the spread of droplets through close contact caused most of the early SARS cases, SARS might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets has touched. Airborne transmission is a real possibility in some cases. Live virus has even been found in the stool of people with SARS, where it has been shown to live for up to 4 days. The virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.
TEXT_95=In some situations, masks and goggles may be useful for preventing the spread of the disease. You may use gloves when handling any items that may have touched infected droplets.
TEXT_30=.
TEXT_94=Clean commonly touched surfaces with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
TEXT_93=Do not share food, drink, or utensils.
TEXT_92=Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. Droplets that are released when a person sneezes or coughs are infectious.
TEXT_91=Hand hygiene is the most important part of SARS prevention. Wash your hands or clean them with an alcohol-based instant hand sanitizer.
TEXT_90=Reducing your contact with people who have SARS lowers your risk for the disease. Avoid travel to places where there is an uncontrolled SARS outbreak. When possible, avoid direct contact with persons who have SARS until at least 10 days after their fever and other symptoms are gone.
